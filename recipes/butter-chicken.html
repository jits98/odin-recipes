    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Butter Chicken is also known as chicken makhani or in Hindi as murgh
      makhani. It is an Indian curry made with a base of a spiced tomato gravy
      with plenty of butter (makhan) and yogurt-marinated chicken that's
      traditionally cooked in a tandoor. It's famous for its bold red-orange
      color, silky smooth creamy texture, and rich flavors.

      You may think Butter Chicken is centuries old, but it really came about in
      the mid-1900s! In the 1950s, Kundan Lal Gujral, the founder of restaurant
      Moti Mahal in New Delhi, developed this world-famous dish on accident by
      combining leftover tandoori chicken with a tomato-based gravy with butter,
      or makhani. You can still visit the restaurant today to try their famous
      creation.

      Today, we see Butter Chicken served not only by itself but in burritos, on
      top of pizzas, in wraps, and more. This dish has truly become world famous
      for its richness and bold flavor. And it's not without some drama and a
      lawsuit to determine who can lay claim to the true origins of this dish!

      From Butter Chicken came Chicken Tikka Masala and while similar, they are
      not the same dish. Butter Chicken has its origins in India and uses more
      butter, while Chicken Tikka Masala is a British dish with a more
      concentrated tomato flavor.
